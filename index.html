        <h1>Working with this lawfirm has been a nightmare. </h1><br>
        <h2>I originally had my license suspended for 3 months due to excessive speeding tickets. I contacted Biebas and
            Riley Attorneys at law for help getting an ODL. I told them I had set up a court date and they said not to
            worry
            about it. I then get a letter in the mail stating that my LICENSE IS SUSPENDED FOR A YEAR. This is because I
            didnt't go to the court date, which I was told not to worry about. They then went to the judge to appeal it,
            this has been a nightmare. It's very stressful thinking you won't be able to drive for a year. <br> <br>

            This incompetent lawfirm, was unable to convince the judge that it wasn't my fault. I now have 3 months
            where I
            cannot get a ticket or my license is suspended again. This is because of them. I am worse off than how I
            started. <br><br>
            I asked for some of my money back since I feel pretty screwed, and he tried to blame it on me. $1000 just to
            add stress to an already stressful situation.<br><br>
